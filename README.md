### About me ðŸ‘‹

I am an Economics (BSc) graduate from the City University of London. I have developed excellent leadership qualities and key customer service skills due to my previous work experience within retail. My time working for cube, I developed the soft skills necessary to excel in a professional working environment. 

I am currently working towards completing my Data Technician course with JustIT Training, in which I will be trained and fully equipped with the skills and knowledge to work within data. My determination and dedication are highlighted by my achievement on being a three-time boxing national champion and a seven-time London champion, making multiple appearances in the newspaper, and competing on a regular basis.

I have high aspirations in life and take pride in the tasks I carry out for myself and others because I find more enjoyment in doing the task rather than the results they bring. This way, good results come naturally with the utility of finishing a task. Looking to find employment within something data related ideally, applying my training, and combining my soft skills with the data presentation skills to create professional presentations.
